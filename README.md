Anti_Sleep.dsp
    This file (the project file) contains information at the project level and
    is used to build a single project or subproject. Other users can share the
    project (.dsp) file, but they should export the makefiles locally.

    This is the main header file for the application.  It includes other
    project specific headers (including Resource.h) and declares the
    CAnti_SleepApp application class.

    This is the main application source file that contains the application
    class CAnti_SleepApp.

Anti_Sleep.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored
    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft
	Visual C++.

Anti_Sleep.clw
    This file contains information used by ClassWizard to edit existing

    information needed to create and edit message maps and dialog data
    maps and to create prototype member functions.
